# Staging Interaction

\*\***Collaborators: Khushi Bhansali, Net ID kb737 ([GitHub Page](https://github.com/Khushibhansali/Interactive-Lab-Hub))**\*\*

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre-to-stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Read about Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
2. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
3. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.


### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. 7 Storyboards
1. 3 Sketches/photos of costumed devices
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Part A. Plan 

To stage an interaction with your interactive device, think about:

_Setting:_ Where is this interaction happening? (e.g., a jungle, the kitchen) When is it happening?

_Players:_ Who is involved in the interaction? Who else is there? If you reflect on the design of current-day interactive devices like the Amazon Alexa, it’s clear they didn’t take into account people who had roommates, or the presence of children. Think through all the people who are in the setting.

_Activity:_ What is happening between the actors?

_Goals:_ What are the goals of each player? (e.g., jumping to a tree, opening the fridge). 

The interactive device can be anything *except* a computer, a tablet computer or a smartphone, but the main way it interacts needs to be using light.

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

**Scenario:** Sound waves are everywhere. And everywhere, sound waves are intensifying. Noise pollution adversely affects the health of millions of people every day. Studies in humans have shown that in addition to hearing loss, exposure to loud noise can cause high blood pressure, heart disease, sleep disturbances, and stress. Increasing noise pollution also negatively impacts the health and well-being of wildlife, both on land and at sea. Many animals use sound to navigate, attract mates, and find food. These are all vital tasks that determine an animal's ability to survive. In other words, noise disruptances can affect the survival of entire populations of species.

**Motivation for Interactive Device:** In hopes of mitigating the adverse effects of noise pollution on the human population, the interactive device described below will alert the end user if exposed to unhealthy noise levels. 

**_Setting:_** The interaction is happening throughout every activity the end user performs. It is happening at the 6AM yoga class, at the park, while driving to work, in the evening when mowing the lawn, walking through the streets during rush hours, in autumn preparing for winter (gathering wood for the chimney), at night while attending a rock concert, etc. 

**_Players:_** An individual who wants to protect his/her ears and those of the people near him/her. 

**_Activity:_** The individual goes about his day carrying or wearing his interactive device. Meanwhile, the interactive device samples ambient noise every 5 seconds and informs the user via a color display the degree of noise pollution he/she is exposed to. 

**_Goals:_** Reduce one's exposure to noise pollution in order to enhance well-being.

Storyboards are a tool for visually exploring a users interaction with a device. They are a fast and cheap method to understand user flow, and iterate on a design before attempting to build on it. Take some time to read through this explanation of [storyboarding in UX design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/10/storyboarding-ux-design/). Sketch seven storyboards of the interactions you are planning. **It does not need to be perfect**, but must get across the behavior of the interactive device and the other characters in the scene. 

\*\***Include pictures of your storyboards here**\*\*

**Legend:** Noise level in decibels (dB) color-coded.

Present your ideas to the other people in your breakout room (or in small groups). You can just get feedback from one another or you can work together on the other parts of the lab.

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*
  1. What if the end-user is color-blind? How might he/she be informed of the degree of the noise pollution (minimal to severe) without being confused by the colors?
  2. What if the end-user is blind? 

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*
- I originally thought I would be more attentive to the changes in color while doing regular activities throughout the day. However, that was not the case. As someone who tries to minimize screentime as much as possible, I would dislike having to constantly glance at the interactive device to verify whether the noise pollution I am exposed to exceeds the recommended upper limit. Though auditive alerts are not appropriate for this application, some type of alert should call the user's attention if the noise levels are close to reaching those that could cause hearing damage. The device should make greater and greater efforts to alert the user if the noise level continues to intensify past the safe limits.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*
- If the user is not looking at the interactive device, should he/she be alerted via vibration of an unhealthy increase in noise level?
- What if in addition to only alerting the user of exposure to noise pollution, the interactive device could also help mitigate the adverse consequences of noise pollution by dampening the noise pollution if the decibels measured exceed a certain threshold. For example, the Centers for Disease Control advises that prolonged exposure to noise above 70 dB starts to deteriorate one's hearing sensitivity. Additionally, noises above 120 dB result in immediate harm to the ears.
> - Therefore, to reduce or eliminate harmful noise levels, the interactive device could generate anti-noise sounds to cancel or reduce the perceived noises of the environment.

- An air pollution sensor could be designed in a similar way as the noise pollution sensor described. Refer to the rough storyboard below of the air pollution interaction. **NOTE:** For the purposes of this lab, we will focus on the noise pollution interactive device.

## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smartphone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can manually or remotely control.

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*
- After several hours of troubleshooting Tinkerbelle on my Ubuntu 22.04 system, though I could run ```tinker.py``` successfully, I could not connect to the ```localhost``` on my Ubuntu system nor on my iPhone, which were both connected to the same WiFi. I made sure to turn off all firewalls and VPNs on both devices. I also created a new virtual environment specifically for running Tinkerbelle. Unfortunately, that didn't make a difference on my Ubuntu system. I decided to switch over to my Windows 10 partition and run it from there. Tinkerbelle ran successfully on the first try, including connecting to ```localhost:5001```. 
> - It would be appreciated if Tinkerbelle could be made compatible with Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu 22.04.

## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene that you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop three costumes so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: Is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.**\*\*
Costume #1 & #2:
![image](https://github.com/wjr83/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/143034234/2d3b5775-eb0f-480a-8dc2-8931a5e51ebd)

Costume #3: Student ID or Work ID will flash a decibel color according to the ambient noise loudness measured.
![image_6487327](https://github.com/wjr83/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/143034234/0d0a3cc9-68a5-4f74-9540-009e941d8295)

**NOTE:** Water can damage all three of these costumes/devices if the noise pollution feature is turned on at the moment of water ingress.

\*\***What concerns or opportunities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*
- Hospital systems have programs where physicians exposed to radiation are required to wear dosimeters to help record total radiation over time. Dosimeters are devices that measure and record the amount of radiation a person receives. They are required by state and federal regulations if someone is likely to receive more than 10% of the maximum permissible dose. Dosimeters in the hospital setting usually look like badges and these pass by unnoticed by most who are unaware of this technology.
> - Costume #3 shown above was inspired by thinking exclusively about dosimeters used by interventional radiologists. It was also my intention to incorporate the decibel sensor into everyday objects, such that the end-user will carry this interactive noise sensor device at all times without having to remember to grab it. Objects that we usually carry on our daily routines are:
> > - A watch (costume #1)
> > - Keys (this inspired the keychain of costume #2)
> > - A student ID or work badge (costume #3)

## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design. 



# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code! 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
